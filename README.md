# QtTest
Testing and learning Qt functionality; Knowledge gained will be used in future Qt based applications;

## Starter
The starter project is my first Qt interaction. Basic components.
## Layout
The layout project is focused on the layout aspect of Qt.
## addressBook
Address book project is a program that will store the name and address of users.

I also implemented the feature of navigating through the saved addresses. 
## temperature
The temperature project focuses on combining Qt and an MCU with a sensor.
I'm using Qt as a dashboard platform to show the sensor read values. The MCU used is an ESP32 with an AM2302 temperature/humidity sensor

The temperature project will also have a stage 2, where I will be working on optimizing it a bit more.
