Starting from the basics.

As I'm familiar with C++, I need to learn more about the API of Qt.

I'm following this link: https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Beginners
And also learning about buttons and other elements from here: 
https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qpushbutton.html
https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qicon.html
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html
